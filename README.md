# Keycard Installer for Android

This is an Android application to install the [keycard applet](https://github.com/status-im/status-keycard) to a 
smartcard via NFC. The compiled cap file of the applet is bundled in the application. Currently, version 2.0rc1 of the
applet is installed.

If you work with the Status Keycard this is a quick utility to reinstall the applet.
